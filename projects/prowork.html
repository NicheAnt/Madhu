      Designing and participating in experiential workshops have been immense
      and intense learning for me in that presented capsule of time.

      <br><br><br><br><br>I spend time and care designing workshops for my group/audience.
      Planning down to the very details, considering all possibilities. And
      during actual sessions, being truly present to what is happening that
      moment and flexible enough to give the person/situation the direction
      and flow that it may need.
      <br><br><br>I love and look forward to invitations to facilitate or collaborate on
      space, project and individual/group dynamics driven workshops.

    <p class="parahigh"><br><br>
      For the playful learner, <a>choice</a> includes a sense of empowerment,
      autonomy, ownership, spontaneity, and intrinsic motivation.
      Learners may experience these feelings individually or as part of a
      group. Collectively making choices, and the accompanying sense of
      being part of something bigger than oneself, can enhance feelings
      of empowerment and ownership. To an observer, learners
      demonstrating choice are setting goals, developing and sharing
      ideas, making and changing rules, and negotiating challenges. They
      are also likely to be choosing collaborators and roles,
      how long to work or play, and when to move around.
    </p>

    <p class="parahigh"><br><br><br><br>
      <a>Wonder</a> entails the experience of curiosity, novelty, surprise,
      and challenge, which can engage and fascinate the learner. To an
      observer, a sense of wonder involves improvising or exploring,
      creating or inventing, pretending or imagining, and taking risks or
      learning from trial and error.
      <br>Wonder can emerge from the ordinary to the extraordinary. A sense
      of wonder may be experienced through play with materials, ideas,
      perspectives, music, symbols, words, languages, stories, movement,
      or other modes of expression.
    </p>

    <p class="parahigh"><br><br><br><br>
      Feelings of <a>delight</a> include excitement, joy, satisfaction,
      inspiration, anticipation, pride, and belonging. Learners who feel
      delighted may smile, laugh, joke, or perhaps be silly. Their
      attention may be focused. Delight may also be experienced through
      playful competition, celebration, or engaging in an altruistic act.

      <a>A pedagogy of play</a> — a systematic approach to the practice of
      playful learning and teaching — is needed to bridge tensions that
      exist between playful learning and the way most schools are
      currently structured.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br>Creating and operationalizing such pedagogy requires a culture
      where playfulness is celebrated, examined, made visible, and better
      understood as a powerful pathway of learning. Indeed, bringing play
      into a central role entails creating a culture that values the core
      tenets of play: taking risks, making mistakes, exploring new ideas,
      and <a class="parai">experiencing joy.</a>

      Towards a Pedagogy of Play published by
      Project Zero, a research center based at
      the Harvard Graduate School of Education.

      Although an emergent field that people are paying attentention to,
      as a society we are still far from adopting and embracing
      playfulness as a quality to develop and encourage. Through hisory,
      in all our various cultures, play has seen the manifestation
      through forms of games.
      <br><br><br>Games:
      <br>Competition, Choice, Simulation and Vertigo
      <br><br><br>The classification is from the text Man, Play and Games by Roger
      Caillois. Although the writing seems biased and lacking of a more
      holistic perspective of cultures and gender, the classification
      presented is nevertheless an interesting place to look at the kinds
      of play that different games induce. It also goes on to speak of
      the corrupted forms of game that exist and what their negative
      aspects can affect.
      <br><br><br><br>
      Animals seem to know - as though it’s a common language to share,
      playing. Play is a state of mind and being, a form of engagement
      and expression, a way of learning and living. The openess that play
      invites is magical. It is still strange to me that so many people
      perceive it as something only for the younger years of one’s life
      or as frivilous, shallow, unimportant or of no consequence. Tough
      nuts, hard to crack.
      <br><br><br>I feel for the future there will be emergent attempts to create
      more play for adults. Replanting something that will be feared lost
      at some point.
      <br><br><br>And I am grateful for all the spaces, children, adults and animals
      in my life that teach me new forms of play.

    <p><br><br><br><br>There is a war raging.
      <br>It feels like a non-dual phenomena - what we are subjecting
      natural and ecological systems of the earth to and the nature of
      illness and dis-ease in human bodies.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>Looking inward to my own body’s response to illness, there is a
      consciousness that affects overall welbeing and the nature of
      safeguarding, protecting and generating the will to thrive, just
      as there is a consciousness that directs the body to get better
      in times of dis-ease. It is the nature, the innate, internal
      nature of certain cells to protect the body. An awareness of the larger systems
      that require a balance of that microscopic life in order to function,
      whose functioning in turn creates the environment for that microscopic life to exist.
      An integrated knowledge by virtue of existance, an awareness of interpependence of existence.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>We need forests, living beings, natural water cycles, the deep
      stored pools of aquifers and oil to exist. These forms of life and
      form are so deeply intricate and interlinked. Yet, we are
      dismanteling billion year old systems at a pace of complete denial
      and no understanding.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br>I have memories from when I was a little younger than three.
      When we used to stay in a housing colony at the edge of the
      forest in a town called Sunabeda in Orissa. This was 1992-1993.
      I loved running below the hedges into everyone’s gardens, skirt
      the edge of the tree line on the other side of the road, wander
      just a little into the jungle.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      My mother, as any sensible adult, tried to warn me of running
      off on my own. She would try and scare me saying that a bear
      would mistake me for one of its babies because of my big mop of
      black curls. I loved the forest as a wild baby would.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>
      We did not stay there long, shifting away to Bangalore in 1994.
      Back when it was a small town, populated by more old trees than
      cars or people put together. Ah, those were the good days. A trail
      of memories from the wild lingeres as I would climb trees, rescue puppies
      and kittens in the monsoon, look out for nests in the neighbourhood trees,
      watch insects of all shapes and sizes crawl and fly, at their various stages of life.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br>
      Then the city swallowed it all.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      It was not until I lived and worked with some truly remarkable
      individuals who are involved with reforestation that something
      so old, so true in me found life again. The beauty in all the
      complexity and balance, whose observation and attempt at
      understandin or absorbing will in itself reveal so much truth
      into the nature of the universe and ourself.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br>
      I am married.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      To the idea, attempt, will and commitment of what it means to
      believe in all the connected forms of life in the wild, in
      forests and grasslands, deserts and oceans, frozen landscapes
      and freshwater.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      Not viewing them as species to be protected or saved, isolated from
      the consequences of actions we commit. But as a part of a deep belief,
      an ideology of an experiential truth.

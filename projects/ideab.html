          <br>A virtual soft-board for pinning ideas.
          <br>Think of them as fruits at various stages of
          ripeness â€“ some still a hard, raw green and some
          more fleshed out, plump and ready to be shared.

      <h3>
        <br><br><br>ADULT GROUPS
        <br><br>: Turtle Soup
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        One person in the group decides a story
        narrative. And they present only the ending to
        the group(this can be a dramatic telling).
        Everyone else then begins to ask questions to
        the storyteller, who can only answer with a
        Yes/No/Maybe. At a given point, the teller will
        know when the group has pieced together the
        entire story.
        <br><br>The process can seem so serendipititious and in
        the flow of a group deciding a collective
        reality together.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br>: Eye Shut Disco
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        Foot stools, cushions or mats - place a number
        suitable for how many people there are, keeping
        some folks as audience. With a good music
        background, everyone on the given platform
        dances and moves to the next with their eyes
        closed. Talking aloud, confirming if they are
        able to go all the way to moving with their eyes
        completely closed. Individuals can switch as
        they wish.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br>: Energy Ball
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        Pass it in what ever form you allow yourself to
        create in that moment with gestures and even
        sound; receive it with awareness. Take time to
        silently reflect what individuals offered and in
        what manner they took.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br>: Hello, Stranger
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        In two lines facing each other, walk to the
        center to exchange glances, words, conversations
        and emotions - as strangers first, then
        aquiantences, to casual friends, to close ones.
        [from a workshop facilitated by Laurie Frank]
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br>: List-o-mania
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        This one can be nice on walks. Everyone takes
        turns giving a list title; common or strange for
        everyone else to add to.
        <br>Eg: Good boy names for girls, Most risky
        situations they have been in, Oldest Memory they
        have, Best combination of three fruits, etc.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br><br>DUETS
        <br><br>: Book-Shelf Interventions
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        Ask a question to the other person. They have to
        listen and absorb the question before picking a
        book from the shelf, still keeping the question
        in their mind they open to a page at random and
        read a paragraph or the whole page. Discuss
        possible interpretations of what is read.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br>: Would you rather..?
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        This or that! Take turns asking questions that
        have strange alternatives. Would you rather be
        as rich as you can imagine and never have the
        ability to experience laughter or would you
        rather travel the world as much as you want but
        not stay anywhere longer than six months?
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br>: They are coming from
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        A game in a public space. Where you decide to
        create a story for where a stranger is coming
        from - picking details of their outfits,
        mannerisms to validate the thought.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br><br>ON YOUR OWN
        <br><br>: That year, this time
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        Choose a time of a season or a month and then
        pick a year. Try to recall what you could have
        been doing and if you have any visual or vivid
        memory of it.
      </p>

        <br><br>: Body-ody-dy-y
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        Silence and a slow down. Focus on one part of
        your body with your eyes closed. Give it
        attention and give it love. Spread out limb to
        limb from there for a few minutes.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br><br>CONCEPTS FOR CLASS
        <br><br>: Name, Place, Animal, Food
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        Either choose a letter of the alphabet and
        research multiple options for it or one option
        each for each letter A-Z. Keep rich research
        material handy to look up and look at.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br>: Letter to a Country
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        Using the Name, Place, Animal, Food game as a
        base, everyone picks a country and writes a
        letter, song/poem/haiku/prose to someone from
        there. It can take the form of a video, a
        diorama, a shadow cut-out.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br>: Treasure Hunt
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">

        activity/project from the group.

      <h3>
        <br><br><br>THEATRE
        <br><br>: If it was me
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        Create a list of situations that are tricky,
        naming the character in question first and the
        circumstances they are caught in.
        <br>  Eg: Character - Neighbour
        <br>  Situation - Getting caught picking up fallen
        <br>  apples from your neighbour's garden!
        <br>Allow students to come up with situations for
        each other. You can give a list of characters to
        start with. Keep a time cap for the role play.
        <br>Use Freeze and Switch for the group to also see
        how different individuals respond to the same situation.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br>: Tracking/Stalking
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        Watch videos of the movement of certains animals (predator
        and prey) to observe in detail how limbs and muscle move,
        how the animal respond to movement, sound and light in their
        environment.
        <br>Split the group into two and assign them an animal for the
        exercise to follow. If you can choose a music piece to go
        with three different levels of movement - slow stalking,
        a quickened and alert pace and a fast chase.
        <br>Go through these in different orders, giving the students
        time to feel out how they want to express themselves.
        Catch a good ending where the energy is high but not exhausted.
      </p>

      <h3>
        <br><br><br>NATURE BASED EXPERIENCES
        <br><br>: Sound Map
      </h3>
      <p class="parai">
        Divide a sheet of paper into 4 quadrents. Mark the center with a
        small circle. This represents the listener. Also mark North, South,
        East and West on the map accordingly (North being the line that moves
        up from the center).
        <br>With some research to where you are taking the group, prepare a few
        recordings to playback that are some of the sounds of the birds and
        animals in that region that they might here.
        <br>Do an exercise before they head out to sharpen their observation and
        prime their ability to diffrentiate sounds.
        <br>Once the walk commences, request silence. The exercise is to listen.
        Each child can choose a spot, within eye range of the others to sit
        and listen. Listen deeply to the sounds around them, closing their
        eyes at first.
        <br>Then slowly, they can start to map the sounds they hear. Representing
        on the map which direction, what intensity and maybe even drawing a
        wave that represents the pattern of the sound.
        <br><br>Once the exercise is over, each individual can share their map with
        the group and discuss any keen observations they had.
      </p>

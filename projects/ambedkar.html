    <p><br><br>1984<br>
      My parents moved to Bangalore soon after their marriage,
      in 1984. Born and brought up here, in Bangalore, I have
      never felt fully connected to the politics of my roots
      in Tamil Nadu and the city in which my parents spent
      their youth - Chennai.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>When I asked them about the dynamics of youth
      and politics in their time, they spoke about this sense
      of pride and nationalism, of a bigger feeling of optimism
      for change and a more confident faith in the system; when
      the country was new and forming and when the role of the
      people was not expendable.<br>
      Between my mother, the youngest of 6 siblings and my father,
      the eldest of 4, I have heard innumerable stories during
      their college years - of marches and strikes, petitions and
      walks, or debates and challenges, dangers and adventures.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>Listening to those decades of movement and
      involvement, of generations that had not yet been disillusioned
      by cynicism or complete distrust in the system, I wonder where
      all that ideology and faith got misplaced.<br>
      And I realized that I am yet to make that journey to discover
      my own.

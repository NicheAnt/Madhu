    <p><br><br><br>·Pay attention to the spirits that guide things.
      Talk to universal forces.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>·Search for reasons older than situations.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>·Trust in the infinite wisdom of your body.
      Care for, listen to, trust.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>·Explore without agenda.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      ·Anchor your learning shrines, your own rituals
      and your guides.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>·Pull Out
      <br>As soon as you feel yourself getting
      plugged into the machine.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>·Resistance is fertility.
      <br>Resistance is the wild.
      <br>Fertility to create.
      <br>The wildness to live free.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      ·Journey with your soul to find the ways
        you perceive and interpret phenomena.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      ·Discover and practice forms of expression.
        Then craft it somewhere you trust
        with a community you believe in.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      ·Give yourself times of isolation and retreat
        to gather. Strengthen and grow.
        This time can involve molting and healing.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      ·Learn to recognise lessons in love.
        Then slowly learn to open your organs to it.
        (And then the tricky art of undoing knots)
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      ·Understand how an environment affects you
        and how you impact it.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      ·Generate.
        <br>Channel and carry your energy with awareness.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      ·Acceptance is the beginning
        of transformation.

      A twist on the PIES terminology; I suggest a bit of SPINE for everyone.
      <br>Social Physical Intellectual Natural Emotional
      <br><br><br><br>Educational theories encourage the practice of involving different
      learning styles and including the different cognitive pathways of
      learning in and out of the classroom.

      <br><br><br>PIES - Physical, Intellectual, Emotional and Social
      <br><br><br>Suggesting that a good balance of these leads to a more holistic
      individual and collective experience of learning. Layering connections,

      <br><br><br>Feet exploring, running

      <br><br>In the grass, on the mud, over the rocks
      <br><br>Connected.<br><br><br><br>

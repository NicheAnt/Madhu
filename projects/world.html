    <p><br><br><br><br><br>I found a letter I wrote in 2006, when I was sixteen and just finishing my tenth standard
      in school. It was after I had read several articles that summer of farmer suicides from consuming pesticide.
      Even though I did not have exposure or knowledge of the system, let alone what it means to farm as a way
      of living - something struck me so strongly as <span class='parai'>wrong</span>. Wrong that somehow the very people who toil
      the land to give the rest of us food are seen as unworthy. Unworthy of the gratitude they deserve from society,
      unworthy of help when circumstances are dire, unworthy of hailing their work as something to aspire towards.
    </p>
    <p>I must have spat on the 'modern ideals' of success early. And I'm grateful for it
    </p>

    <p><br>No journey of spirituality can be undertaken without a deep connection to the spirits of the earth
      and cosmos. And something is very wrong with the direction in which most things are moving.
    </p>

    <p><br>Crave, consume, crave, consume, hurt, burn.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>We have been <span class='parab'>disrupting</span> (and I hate that business jargon has now altered the meaning of this world
      too, making it seem like something desirable) the natural order of things for a while now. ANyone who has woken up
      even slightly will be aware of the consequences that have been breeding since. And these go beyond the ecological
      and the physical - affecting the collective atmosphere of desires, ego, tolerance and our sense of belonging.
    </p>

    <p><br>I don't believe in turning things around, I don't believe in saving the planet, I don't think the planet
      needs saving.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>I do believe in making choices in this lifetime that imprint that timeless soul, in listening into the
      voice of things and following one's heart. And the power of an individual doing so on those around them,
      consciousness stirring consciousness.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>When we severed our communal relationship with nature, I feel it also deeply affected our sense
      of purpose.
    </p>

    <p><br>A friend once asked,<span class='parai'>"How different would our histories and present be as a race if we were unable
        to see the stars in the night sky?"</span>
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br>Our myths, legends, and stories may not have been as inspired.
      <br>Ancient gatherings around fire would have felt isolated.
      <br>Different races may not have travelled as much.
      <br>We may not have realised that we live on a planet in a galaxy.
      <br>Or the knowldege of some of its inner workings we now know.
      <br>We may have never discovered the idea of the vast cosmos.
      <br><br>And humans would have felt far, far lonelier.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>When I'm back in a city, when I look up I see hardly a handful of stars and I wonder how many people
      spend any of their nights looking up, asking where they went.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>A wiseman once said, "Whether you get your food and water from the forests, or farming, or
      the supermarket - you will defend everything that supports it."
      <br>Survival.

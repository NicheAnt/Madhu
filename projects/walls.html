      <p><br>A collaborative mural with artist Ishita Dharap
        for Devrai Artist Village, located in the beautiful
        hills of Panchgani. The forms on the textured stone walls
        took life in white, indigo and rust.

        <figcaption>The wall was situated along the drive-way
          entering Devrai. Shaded by trees, the land spoke between branches and leaves.

        Welcomed into the home of the family that began Devrai,
        Ishita and I had a gift of a week to spend painting. Our
        schedule looked something like this:
      </p>
      <p class="leftpara parasmall">
        <br>- waking up at 6 in the morning
        <br>- making ourselves a cup of black tea to go with a banana and biscuit
        <br>- carry the supplies to the wall
        <br>- resume painting--- playlist at hand
        <br>- till about 10-11 by which time the sun would be quite strong
        <br>- breakfast at the house--- winter time had many fresh strawberries, what joy
        <br>- mid morning nap
        <br>- lunch and long conversations
        <br>- nap
        <br>- resuming painting---again, playlist at hand, this time turban on <head>
        <br>- evening walk/hike/ride with wonderful Rudransh who would show us such lovely insights
        <br>- dinner
        <br>- nightcap---songs, stories, bonfire
      </p>
      <p class="leftpara">
        <br>Thank you. Those days were precious and giving.

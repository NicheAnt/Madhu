    <p><br><br><br><br>The first whales evolved 50 million years ago.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>The modern form of humans evolved about 200,000 years ago. And
      humans began farming about 10,000 years ago.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>Which means we have been hunter-gatherers for over 10,000
      generations of our lineage and farming for about 500 generations.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      How many generations have we allowed to hone trial and error,
      mistakes and learning, understanding and application of action and
      consequence in modern fields of this millenia before we call
      ourselves experts?
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br>
      The world population was 1.2 billion before the discovery of oil and
      the advent of the Industrial age.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      It is now over 7.4 billion and estimated to reach
      9.7 billion by 2050.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      Studies show that tigers began evolving 3.2 million years
      ago. By estimates in 2010, there are less than 3,890 tigers
      in the wild. </p>
    <p class="parab"> Their habitat once extended all across East and
      South-East Asia.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>We’re such shits.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>We have driven 41,415 species to serious threat, and 16,306 of them
      are endangered species close to extinction.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      To most people those numbers would seem abstract and meaningless.
      What species, where, how did it happen, what difference does it
      really make?
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      What difference can it make to someone who has not yet had the
      experience of staring at the natural world around them for no reason
      but to take some of it in; oberve, reflect, listen and feel.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>Because it’s always speaking.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br>
      Every educated human should go through the initiation of
      learning narratives of history that are other than
      anthropological.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      It’s a dangerous to grow up with the singular perspective that
      the modern human life is the only future to make decisions about
      or where to understand the past from.
    </p>

      Exploitation is too easily denied by priviledge. Discrimination
      is too easily enforced by priviledge. Self-imposed law by
      priviledge in power is totalitarian.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      What comes after checking the priviledge we have or finding a
      way to express the exploitation we face?

      I am the younger of two sisters. I was the sibling with the
      strange habits of rationing my own treats over days so I could
      somehow enjoy it longer, the one who stretched the use of a
      favourite article of clothing, the child who found five uses for
      a piece of cardboard before it had to be thrown out, the student
      who picked fights with others who trashed the room or the grounds,
      the teenager who loved the old city that Bangalore once was for
      the trees and the greenery, the young adult who looked up and read
      about the terms for different kinds of governence and wondered why
      we didn’t study about that in school. The young adult who
      questioned systems of centralised power. The young woman who
      questioned the nature of the cages around her, who then started
      to build her own reasoning born of intuition. And let that seep
      into the choices of how she wants to live.

      If one can even glimpse at timeline of different scales
      - of microbes and forest ecosystems, of geological
      events and patterns of climate, the inhale and exhale of
      water in its various forms in and on our planet, the
      precise conditions it takes for minerals, natural oils
      and gases to form beneath the surface, for creatures to
      respond to each factor of their environment and evolve.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      If one can even have a small glimpse into the depth of
      these phenomena, we might share a connectedness that
      could invite a more balanced and sustainable way of
      living and caring.

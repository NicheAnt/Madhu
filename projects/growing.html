    <p><br><br><br><br><br>Green thumbs and beating hearts.
      <br>Gratefulness, gratitude.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>The events have been recounted several times of the years.
      My grandmother would look after me when I was very young. My father, away at work
      and my mother, a teacher and my sister a student gone for the day at school.
      I honestly have no recollection of what scheming it took, but apparently when my
      grandmother would go in for her bath, I would lock the door half way through and
      run away into the gardens so I could play on my own, unsupervised. She would
      have to shout out to the gardner or the maid to come unlock her. This went on
      for several months, my grandmother trying all sorts of ways to avoid the
      imprisonment. Till finally everyone became okay with me playing without an overseeing eye.
      My mother would still get calls in the evenings saying that her daughter was scrounging
      in their garden or backyard. You see, they were all just one big connected land
      separated by hedges that would have gaps under them.
      I remember that.

    <p><br><br><br><br>Both my grandmothers had green thumbs and healing hands.

      Friends, most recently -
      The summer of 2017 was spent labouring, readying, planning, sowing
      and tending to a new beautiful garden in Marpha. As part of the
      foundation’s plan to include a growing space as an extention of
      their teaching-learning programs.
      It was the first time I had the experience of watching such a
      range of bountiful plants and herbs grow from seed to harvest.
      In most rewarding climate, mineral and nutrient rich water and soil.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>The process began with research and planning of our garden work,
      making hugelkulture beds, a nursery for the seedlings, drawing up
      plans for each bed according to favourably companion planting.
      We also planned our garden work - sowing, tranplanting, heavy watering
      and enriching according to the lunar cycles. What a gift to witness
      the transformation from bare land to lush and abundant greenary.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>I am grateful for working so closely with the two other incredible humans
      whose first garden it was as well. Nishant and Jessica at the Foundation.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>Green thumbs, like beating hearts do not rest.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>My next garden - a balcony, a strip of earth, pots or someone
      else’s piece of land - awaits. I have started to dream of leaves.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>And it is beginning at GoodEarth in Kengeri with the community
      shared gardens that the incredibly thoughtful architects included
      in the landscaping and designing of the space.

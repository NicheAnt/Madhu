      A philosophy which embraces transformative learning that emerges
      from a direct experience which is designed intuitively and
      intelligently for a particular group/individual, within a safe
      learning environment and guided by a facilitator.

      A crafted raw performance set to an ever-changing rhythm,
      with a participating audience creating waves
      that wash into the organ of learning.

    <p class="parablue parab"><br><br>
      A fine, fine balance. Good facilitation holds an outcome in sight
      while planning and designing, yet lets go of any agenda while
      being present with the group/individual. There is no recipe here
      that involves heirarchy, judging, rescuing or condemning. And
      definitely no free/costly dispensing of advice.
      <br><br>There is wonderful science and psychology involved in the
      choreography of guided experiences in order to make the learning
      most impactful. Again, remember that there i s n o agenda forced o n
      any individual. A good facilitator genuinely loves what they do
      and cares for whom they are working with.-
      <br><br>Build trust and then act with generosity and kindness;
      asserting firmness when required.<br><br><br><br>

    <p><br><br>One can view the origin of villages as self-sustained food economies.
      Each region, based on the natural resources and culture, created
      its own unique identity of textiles and crafts.
      A mention of the knowledge and practice of arts and crafts cannot
      be mentioned without acknowledging the deep and injust sever it
      underwent during periods of colonization. Some patronage these
      days is allowing for certain pockets to reemerge, however, the mass
      direction of textiles and objects that fill homes are dependent on
      industrial manufacturing.

    <p><br><br>' Painting and sculpture were organically one with
      architecture, as that was one with the social purpose that
      living spaces served. Music and song were intimate parts of
      rites and ceremonies in which the meaning of group life was
      consumated. Drama was a vital reenactment of legends and
      history of group life. Sports celebrated and enforced
      traditions of race and group. Art reflected emotions and
      ideas associated with chief institutions of social life.
      The segregation of art from common life reflects the fact
      that they are not part of a native and spontaneous culture.
      Objects that were in the past valid and significant because
      of their place in the life of a community now function in
      isolation from the conditions of their origin. By the fact
      they are also set apart from common experience and serve as
      certificates of special culture.
      Put the action of all such forces together and the
      conditions that create the gulf between producer and
      consumer in modern society to create also a chasm between
      ordinary and aesthetic experience. '

      Most of my engagement with art and community begins with this
      acknowledgement. Research into what the community of that region
      once (or still) practiced and learning from them. In some other
      spaces, where the thread is not continuous - learn how to invite the
      new generation to participate in creation of their own narratives.
      Acknowledging vernacular traditions and knowledge is also an
      incredibly rich process. But unless it is a strong community that
      has protected its practices, it can leave one with a lingering sense
      of loss. In those times, the omnipresent organs of storytelling can
      come forth and breathe new life into imagination and memory.

      Marpha, Mustang district in Nepal
      <br>Himalayan valley, edge of the rainshadow region
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      I have been working with a local NGO, Marpha Foundation, on
      education and community projects since 2014
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      Located in a seat of one of the deepest gorges, on the banks of the
      Kali Gandaki river, Marpha is surrounded on one side by the Nilgiri
      range and by the Daulagiri range on the other. A strong community
      of the village that not only makes governing decisions but also
      enterprising ones for the welfare of the village are the Thakali.
      Their history with trade dates back to when salt from the Tibetan
      plains used to supply much of the Indian subcontinent. Being the
      wealthier families, it is their children who migrate to other parts
      of the country and world. The marginal community, that comprise most
      of the farm and house labour, are whose children will grow up to be
      the next generation of community. They attend the government school
      and grow up with a fear or hatred of learning. Our before and after
      school classes engage in unlearning the fear and building a sense
      of curiosity, creativity and play.
    </p>

    <p><br>It has been an incredible journey building relationships with the
      children and the mothers over the years. Classes and projects begin
      from a conversation and continue as a creative collaboration with
      them. I am always conscious of gauging the relevance of themes and
      being sensitive of context. I am extremely grateful for all of my
      time there, including what experiencing the 2015 earthquakes taught
      me.

      My learnings include: ways of farming, the culture of villages in
      this valley, integrating into the community, creating workspace and
      recreational community space for volunteers, local and relevant
      methods of teaching different age groups, studying lunar and weather
      patterns, harvesting wild herbs, ways of fermentation, local
      recipes, waste management through art projects

      Kannathampoondi, Tiruvannamalai district in Tamil Nadu, India
      <br>Hot, dry, rainshadow region of edge of the Eastern Ghats
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      Working with The Forest Way as part of their reforestation programme
      and at Marudam Farm School as a Theatre teacher and creative teacher
      for nature projects, 2015-2017
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      The village lies at the edge of a temple town and has been in the
      middle of constant flux over the decades since Independence to a
      more globalized time in south India. Still holding a stong
      linguistic and cultural identity of Tamilian life, the population
      is a mix of farmers, tradespeople, townspeople of various
      professions, foreigners and city-folk who have settled in this area.
      The Arunachala hill seems to draw people of some spiritual
      awakening, and there is a stirring of a movement back to organic
      practices of farming and other expressions of more simple ways of
      living. Tiruvannamalai also seems to have links to Auroville,
      another center of spiritual and cultural reawakening, just two hours
      away by road.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      Some of my personal learnings have included:
      <br>integrating into a self-emerged community, learning about native
      species of trees and shrubs of the region, forms of plant
      intelligence, ways of forests, life in forests, creating exercises
      to engage senses in natural environments, gardening and
      permaculture, cooking with wood fire, baking, fermenting, forms of
      weaving, pottery and firing

      Chennekothapalli, Anatapur District, Andhra Pradesh
      <br>Extremely hot, dry, arid region
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      Working with projects of the Timbaktu Collective,
      February-May 2015
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      The organization is well established in the region with many
      successful projects. The most impressive of which are reintroducing
      organic farming of millets in the region, running a school on the
      land and supporting local youth groups.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      Some of what I engaged in and learned from:
      <br>conducting workshops for the local teachers, creating a system of
      waste segregation on the land, participating in workshops for local
      farmers, understanding harvesting and processing of grains for
      market, spending time at the weaving unit, participating in local
      festivals and gatherings/functions, fighting forest fires

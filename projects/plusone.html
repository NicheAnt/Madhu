    <p><br><br>
      It took me some years to understand and embrace that the work that
      truly excites and motivates me are community based collaborative work.
      <br>My sense of purpose in work comes from sharing a vision with
      individuals/group that involve an creative expression of ideology,
      imagination and compassion.

      <br><br><br>Collaborating with Tilo at Marudam school to experience the forest in
      new ways with a group of 6 students. Where we spent months using each
      sense to go out into the forest and then find ways of sharing what we
      experienced through descriptions, drawings, sculptures and collections.

      <br><br><br>Working with Jessica, the director of Marpha Foundation, has been an
      incredible relationship of mentor and collaborator that I am
      immeasurably grateful for.

      <br><br><br>Karishma, Malashree, Jolien, Maithreyi, Jazz, Nishant, Nikita, Aman -
      some of the many incredible educators who I have had the chance to work
      with over the years.

      <br><br><br>Planning, sowing and caring for a beautiful garden with Nishant.
      Teaching, working, making decisions of all sizes and sharing life
      journeys together.

      <br><br><br><br>And all the incredible women and artists I find myself journeying with
      since our time together at college - Ishita, Tanvee, Sindhu, Rajasee,
      Rucha, Avani, Ragini, Aman, Mahafrin, Alagu, Pooja, Varshita, Gauri,
      Natasha and Vasundhara - creators and practictioners of such
      interdisciplinary fields.
      <br>I am grateful for each strong individual that makes this tribe, this
      community that truly seems to rejuvinate all senses when we gather.

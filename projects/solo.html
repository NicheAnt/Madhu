    <p><br><br><br>On my own, not alone.
      <br>There is a deep wisdom that comes over time, only from the silence
        of solitude.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>It’s a tricky place to be - in one’s head. Without initiation of
      some kind of ancient knowledge it can be hard. For those who have
      absorbed trauma of any form, without healing it can be almost
      impossible.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>In order to be functioning for the good of the people around me and
      the environment I live in - I require regular solitude. To reflect,
      process, dissolve what harms and absorb what I learn. To heal and
      strengthen. To molt and grow. To create.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>This is not an unusual demand. I believe it is a requisite for
      anyone to be healthy, any community to be healthy.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      A lot of harm expressed, internally and externally, comes from not
      having processed something that has occured to a person. Knowing how
      difficult it can be when one is weakened or hurt, I also know the
      support and strength specific people can give you; like totems
      beaconing you back home to a safe and good place. To know when you need
      one, to know when to be one. I am learning how to carry that force
      with me where ever I go.<br><br><br><br>

    <p><br><br>‘There are places I remember
      All my life though some have changed
      Some forever not for better
      Some have gone and some remain
      All these places have their moments
      With lovers and friends I still can recall
      Some are dead and some are living
      In my life I've loved them all’
      - In My Life,
      The Beatles
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>This is a love letter, a letter for love.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>
      With each person I have been in a relationship with,
      I have known instantly that this human in front of me is
      going to be somehow significant in my life.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>Intially platonic, something deep and intuitive. Fallen into that moment from
      different lifetimes. I feel my being pulled towards all of them.
      And at first, I feel as bold as love. Then, the hard work.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>
      A relationship, to me, seems a reflection of oneself. The closer
      one is to another person, the more innards of tangled sinew and
      locked bones emerge. The gory bits of another, but more so - the
      gory bits of oneself. Blood on the hands.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>With the beauty, blood. I know my hearts sings with the moments
      that I can see the delicate, strong, rooted and growing person
      that I am with. Humming with the lightness of laughter shared and
      sillyness witnessed. Skips, jumps and runs for the giddyness of
      love felt, love shown. Heart beat, hearts beat. But it can also
      carry the weight of torn words and insensitive gestures, ours
      both. Heavy with the the truth that there are parts of us that
      chafe at each other and we still have the stubborness of young
      hearts; two dogs at a bone not willing to give up their bite.
      I know I still have so many aspects of myself to understand and
      undo. So many parts that need healing from hurt - old, old wounds
      whose origins I may not even know. Most of the time, these wounds
      need a wolf’s nature to heal. Alone, on one’s own. In connection
      with the hum of the larger universe.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>What I want to learn is the strength to walk with grace. To
      understand the timing of love better and be at peace with it.
      To be at ease with absence and the closeness of continuous presence.
      Feel the lifetime of a journey with a partner and recognise its death.
      And to also know that death renews another life.
      I perceive it as a dual nature now. One or the other, together or
      apart. With someone or alone. On my own, I am somehow able to let
      in a multitude of other relationships. I feel myself more open,
      inviting serendipititous and genuine encounters. Journeying souls
      crossing paths.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      I know I need solitude from time to time, for phases in my life
      that I can only do on my own. The question is still murky,
      stretching without form between my fingers, how to balance
      returning to that one person and the direction of the
      larger questions in my life that will lead me to the people who
      will continue to stay important in my life.
      Collisions of spirits and souls, stars in orbit.

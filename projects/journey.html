    <p><br><br>What are you?
    </p>

    <p><br><br>A creative force of strength and care, connected to the natural cycles of the earth and moon,
      to the cycles of bith and death, or caring for and letting go, of incubating and forming. Of womb, of heart, of
      intuition and breath. Of hands, and feet, thighs and hips, of waists and breasts, of shoulders and neck, of hair.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>Every soul, woman or man, must be allowed the freedom to
      explore their sense of gender-identity without being forced
      into categories that conform, or oppress.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>There is a certain quality of a remarkable individual that transcends
      gender. One might express deep characteristics of feminity and masculinity
      in different fractions and forms, but it is a quality of grace to
      move fluidly between them. And this can allow to bloom a deep understanding of
      each other.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>
      Many of us, however, are still reeling from years of deep hurt that runs
      several generations long of prepetrated wounds inflicted on the basis
      and bias of gender. Openly, there is the obvious truth that women are
      forced into innumerable and unsufferable situations of injustice.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>Seemingly irrational violence always loops the thread of the question, 'Why?'
      right back to the history of the perpetrator.Whether the wounds are self-inflicted
      or externally initiated, the hurt is deep. So deep that the memory of the attacks
      are forgotten and only the vengence for repeating the hurt that is felt.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>These are words of violence.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br><br>Words of Hope.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      A piece of writing that has been guiding and revealing is the book
      The Women Who Run With The Wolves. The connections and stories and
      archetypes are rooted in culture much older than any written history.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>
      It struck me how this knowledge is innate in most of us. It might
      be laying dormant, waiting for the right string of words, the melody
      of bones, the spirits of the forests - to stir it awake. The
      awakening preceeds an opening into a form of higher consciousness.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>Energy work
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      I find this an integral part of my journey of discovery and
      understanding of people and phenomena. I hesitate to describe it in
      words as I am a novice, even if I intuitively feel I am deeply
      connected to healing practices.
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      I am still understanding the flow of energies; drawing and
      channeling strength. I am also aware of how much self-work it takes
      to become that vessel - to hold and allow things to flow, to not
      cling to singular ways of things that cause one to react, absorb and
      create knots in the body that block flow and eventually create pools
      of illness and dis-ease.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>
      Knowing that is is wisdom that weaves through generations of practioners,
      I seek a mentor.

        <p>
          <br>Below are some themes that I find central to my
            practice. No fixing, or preaching The Way. Just
            engaging to understand better and have the
            opportunity to create – what is outside of
            oneself, reflected within.

      <p class="parablue">
        Opening, deepening connections with the natural world;
        creating exercises that deeply engage the senses through
        observation and forms of expressing the experience.
        <br>Designing curriculum that involves engaging with curiosity,
        investigating, experimenting, exercising creative thinking
        and assuming responsibility.

        An approach that starts at sources of strengths and stating
        a collective vision for the future, versus a problem-solving
        approach that begins with stating issues of concern.
        <br>Themes for appreciative-inquiry based curriculum can include
        not just science and environmental themes, but also as wide as
        gender, group dynamics, forms of expression, learning styles,
        decision making and execution among a few.

      <p class="parablue">
        Stories are one of the oldest forms of communicating
        experience/learning. A living language that has many ancient
        roots and takes life in many forms. The art and craft of
        storytelling can be extremely powerful – engaging memory,
        senses, imagination and empathy.

        <br><br>All beginning with intentionality.
        <br>Theatre is one of the most powerful tools to use as a
        transformative process. It requires a guide to be entirely
        present, draw challenges while maintaining a safe space for a
        group to express vulnerebility and boldness.

        Play opens, play unlocks.
        <br>It is said that play is one of the best ways to explore and
        discover the unknown; for the brain to form new neural
        pathways; to put in practice what one is learning; to observe
        and learn about another human or creature; to express some of
        the oldest ways of interacting as a group.

      <p class="parablue">
        Observe, imagine, interpret, express, critique, absorb,
        transform. Transform perspective, transform opinion,
        transform expression.
        <br>Exercises in developing visual language and skills to choose
        and use one’s tools.

      <h3 class="parablue">
        <br><br>: Mindmaps, maps, comics
      </h3>
      <p class="parablue">
        Mapping as a learning tool provides fantastic insight to
        subjects, the dynamics between connected topics and phenomena,
        the relationship of the learner to the subject, collective
        awareness of a group and so many more layers based on how the
        question is presented.
        <br>Comics often allow children to project their imagination,
        reality blended with fantasy. It is a great tool to introduce
        conceptual and abstract themes, allowing for a group to
        express individual perspectives.

        <br><br>: Exercises for creative visual-expression
      </h3>
      <p class="parablue">
        Critical thinking is one of the most effective tools that a
        person can use to respond to things around them. Observation,
        examination/analysis and evaluation based on universal
        intellectual values. A crucial aspect is holding multiple
        perspectives, to form an opinion that transends divisions.
        This involves facilitating discussions and creating a space
        that holds respect for listening.
      </p>

        <br><br>: Discussions, Interventions
      </h3>
      <p class="parablue">
        Added to these is a sense of choreography that connects
        and opens channels – allowing for something authentic to
        emerge from the group.<br><br><br><br>

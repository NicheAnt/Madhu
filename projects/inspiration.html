      Itâ€™s important to create a flow for the cycle of birth and death of
      ideas and inspiration. Choose a good place to store them and
      practice the habit of spring cleaning ever so often.

      The following text is inspired by The Book of Qualities by Ruth Gendler
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br>
      I heard from the Wind about the nature of certain qualities. And a
      faint whisper to the art of making a home to invite them. An art
      that becomes culture through practice within oneself.

      Imagination Patience Creativity Commitment
    </p>

    <p><br><br>
      Imagination was born after her sister Memory.
      <br>Though the two grew up together, their journeys would weave in
      and out over time.They are known to leave cryptic messages and
      riddles for each other at crossroads, totems and dreamcatchers as
      signals, imprints of their presence at junctions.
      <br>As sisters, they rise from deep and similar place, home. And as
      sisters, their whole life is an expression of their difference.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>
      Creativity is inherently generous and her heart always tells her
      to keep moving. She does not need to carry much with her because
      under her fingers, each object seems to transform.
      <br>She often returns to the places she loves. These are places that
      are intoxicated with her presence long after she leaves. The people
      of those places are usually busy attempting to be her lover the
      next time she returns, creating things whispered to them in a
      dream, sung by their hearts when awake.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br>
      Commitment spent years rediscovering forgotten languages. She
      steadily wrote several books on them after but never marked the
      date on any. Most people read just one and can never agree with a
      someone who has read any another. A few people however venture to
      read more, trying to understand the subtleties of each language.
      <br>The books begin and end with a prayer, the full depth of which can
      only be absorbed when accompanied with a ritual of meaning,
      inviting blessing from and thanking the spirits.<br><br><br><br>

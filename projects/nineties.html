    <section>
      <div class='project-body'>
        <p><br><br>I was born in the summer of 1990. My early childhood was infused
          with a fleeting memory of something more intimate than a globalized
          world. That decade held the cusp of change that was to alter our
          direction as a "nation" since.</p>
        <h3><br><br>The following set of prints are illustrated objects,
          icons that dissolved with the collective memory of that
          decade.<br><br></h3>

              <div class='hidden-text'>The orange fizzy drink that meant fun. Remember those innocent photo-page
              advertisements in our Amar Chitra Katha and Tinkle magazines? Evenings after
              school, meticulously gathering the coins to be exchanged at the neighbourhood
              shop so a bottle could be shared between 4 friends.

              <div class='hidden-text'>Father’s first motorized two wheel transport to work. Can it fit the whole
              family? Sure, because it was sold off before I was nine. Who else misses it,
              more so because they never had a chance to get to know it?

              <div class='hidden-text'>Collections spanning decades. We still have a tape my aunt recorded for my
              father before he went to college - A Side featuring Jethro Tull and B Side with
              songs of Tracy Chapman. My collection ends with the last labelled in 2006 -
              ‘Album and radio interview: Continuum JM’.

              <div class='hidden-text'>My imagination has a little nook where I remember the smell of the car from
              falling asleep during long rides. The relative size of a small human to this
              car made it a fortress, a ship and a palace at the will of any make-believe
              game that would ensue.

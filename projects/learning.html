    <p><br><br><br><br><br>Safe, supportive, challenging and reflective.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br>Learning spaces are an extension and expression of the people who hold the space and the vision
      they carry for it.
    </p>

    <p><br>Some of the most inspiring spaces are where individuals live their ideology and understanding, pursuing and
      collaborating their learning journeys together. Where there is no strict distinction between adult and child,
      teacher and learner, novice and master.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br>I find  one of the core intentions of a good learning space is equality; the kind that permiates
      an opennes and willingness in everyone present. A true kind of equality that is believed and felt, in thoughts,
      invitation and action. Where perspectives and truths can exist together without forced heirarchy; instead beginning
      from a place of invitation, acceptance and an awareness of experience.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br>Many people have a misguided assumption that learning spaces exist only in institutions and
      educational organizations. This is a relatively recent phenomenon that seems to disempower the individual the
      ownership of their journey, limiting their choices in holistic learning as a living being in an environment. This
      discrimination hinders the experience of learning in spaces like the home, the neighbourhood, the surrounding
      community and nature.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br>The conditioning is obviously much younger than our natural sense of curiosity and wonder,
      which is present or at least dormant in most of us. this gives me hope fr learners and practicioners to create
      together projects and experiences that spark and open up some of this connected curiosity and wonder.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br>At the same time, I feel it crucial to acknowledge the burden of the system we find ourselves
      carrying the weight of. A system that feeds the Moloch, whose hunger is never satiated. A system that views every
      individual of the world as a cog, a screw, a piece to fit the machine. With the discovery of the smallest difference
      in size or shape, the piece is tossed out. Discarded with no regard and worse, punished for it. Those who fit the
      mould and even better, perform well in it are rewarded and glorified. SOmetimes with no justification of the imbalance
      that this creates. A cruel, cruel way to bring up entire generations in whose hand the future passes.
    </p>

    <p><br><br><br><br><br>I believe in alternative education and open learning spaces as a starting point. But educating
      youth, only to go out and meet a society whose beliefs can crush them doesn't seem right. I feel those of us who have
      made a decision towards an alternative, can share the collective responsibility it will take to make systemic changes,
      starting with ourselves moving outward.<br><br><br><br><br>
